Database Analysis project for Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree

#### Required Software
Follow the [Nanodegree instructions](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/8d3e23e1-9ab6-47eb-b4f3-d5dc7ef27bf0/modules/bc51d967-cb21-46f4-90ea-caf73439dc59/lessons/5475ecd6-cfdb-4418-85a2-f2583074c08d/concepts/14c72fe3-e3fe-4959-9c4b-467cf5b7c3a0) for setting up a Virtual Machine with the database pre-installed.

## Usage
TLDR - Download or clone the repository and run dbLogAnalysis.py using python from within the VM. 

Copy dbLogAnalysis.py to the folder that you are running the VM from.
Log into the VM using 
    
	vagrant ssh #

Run the program in python. The program assumes the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database is running on the localhost.

    python /vagrant/dbLogAnalysis.py
    

Optionally, view the output file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GW-GhostWolf/fullstacknano-dbLogAnalysis/blob/master/dbLogAnalysis.txt).
